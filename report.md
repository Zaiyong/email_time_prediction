##What I did

### Preprocess:
1. Reshape the dataset 
2. One hot-encoding on X3 
3. Normalize X1, X2

### EDA
1. Visualize the distribution and correlations among the dataset. 
2. Calculation the pearson correlatons
### Train/Test with machine learning 
#### Train the data with following regression models:
1. randomforest
2. adaboost
3. GradientBoost
4. SVM

#### Use cross-validation to evaluate the models
#### Use grid search to tuning the models
#### Save the models as files

### Train/Test with deep learning neural network 
1. define a simple deep neural network
2. Use cross-validation to evaluate the model
3. Save he model locally

### Bonus:
1. Build a Docker image that serve the DL model as REST API with flask2
2. Publish the docker image on docker hub
